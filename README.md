# Collections

![CI Badge](https://github.com/smallblue2/collections/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A C library containing various collections to assist C development.

This is mostly for my own learning in the underlying implementation of collections, api design and library creation.

## Current Collections

 - Arena (Growable) = `include/collections/arena.h`
 - Pointer Array = `include/collections/parray.h`

To install:

1. `git clone https://github.com/smallblue2/collections`
2. `cd collections`

This will install:
